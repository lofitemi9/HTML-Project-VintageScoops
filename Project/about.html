            (Image and text is ai generated scary how good ai is at images) Vintage Scoops is a family-owned business that brings the ultimate
            dessert experience to your special day! Our vintage 1979 trailer
            serves hand-dipped, farm-fresh ice cream and decadent hot chocolate
            that will delight your guests. With over 25 delicious flavors to
            choose from, plus waffle cones, cake cones, and bowls, there’s
            something for everyone to enjoy.

            The trailer holds a special place in the owners, Jasen and Emily
            Richardson, hearts as it’s where their love story began. They’re
            thrilled to bring joy to your celebration with this sweet, nostalgic
            touch!
